# PredatorEA

PredatorEA is a forex trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to execute trades on the EURUSD currency pair, specifically on the H1 timeframe. The robot uses predefined default settings for Stop Loss and Take Profit values, which can be adjusted by the user. 

## Default Settings

- StopLoss: 50 pips
- TakeProfit: 100 pips
- MagicNumber: 12345 (unique identifier for the trades)

## How it Works

The OnTick() function is the entry point of the PredatorEA robot. It is called on each tick of the market. The function checks if the current symbol is EURUSD and the timeframe is H1. If these conditions are met, the robot proceeds with evaluating the buy and sell signals.

### Buy Signal

If the IsBuySignal() function returns true, a long position is opened. The entry price is set to the current ask price, and the stop loss and take profit prices are calculated based on the default settings. The OrderSend() function is then called to execute the buy trade.

### Sell Signal

If the IsSellSignal() function returns true, a short position is opened. The entry price is set to the current bid price, and the stop loss and take profit prices are calculated based on the default settings. The OrderSend() function is then called to execute the sell trade.

## Helper Functions

The PredatorEA code includes two helper functions, IsBuySignal() and IsSellSignal(), which are responsible for determining the buy and sell signals, respectively. These functions should be implemented by the user, as they contain the logic for generating the signals. If the conditions for a buy or sell signal are met, the functions should return true; otherwise, they should return false.
